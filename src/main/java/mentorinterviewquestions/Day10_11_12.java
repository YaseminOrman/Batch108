     1) Ask user to enter an integer.
           If the integer is less than 100, tell user "Won!"
           Otherwise, tell user "Lost!"

      2) Type code to print integers from 3 to 6

      3) Type code to print odd integers from 12 to 67 in the same line with a space between them

      4) Type java code by using while loop,
                  Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer.
                  It should then find the sum of the digits of that number.
                  123 ==> 1+2+3 = 6

       5) Type java code by using while loop,
               Write a program that prompts the user to input a number.
               It should then print the multiplication table of that number.
               3x1=3  3x2=6  3x3=9  3x4=12 3x5=15  3x6=18  3x7=21  3x8=24  3x9=27  3x10=30


        6)Example:Type code to get the output like
                     Week: 1
                       Day: 1
                       Day: 2
                       Day: 3
                       .....
                     Week: 2
                       Day: 1
                       Day: 2
                       Day: 3
                       ....
                     Week: 3
                       Day: 1
                       Day: 2
                       Day: 3
                       ....

         7) Write a Java Program to Print Rectangle Star Pattern using For Loop
                     ****
                     ****
                     ****
         Note: Get the number of the rows and the columns from user


         8) Example: Type code to get the output like
                     1
                     1 2
                     1 2 3
                     1 2 3 4
                     1 2 3 4 5

          9)Type code to print digits just in the decimal part of the given decimal number with an asterix.
                    For example; 75.4238 â‡’ *4*2*3*8

          10) Username is "admin", Password is "pwd123"
              Ask user to enter username and password
              User should see "Enter your username and password" message
              hIf user enters correct credentials, e should get "You are in your account!" message
              Otherwise, he should see "Enter your username and password" message 3 times
              After 3 times he should get "Your account is blocked" message

           11)Type code to check if a given integer is palindrome or not
              Palindrome: 121 <==> 121  123321 <==> 123321 nalan <==>nalan
