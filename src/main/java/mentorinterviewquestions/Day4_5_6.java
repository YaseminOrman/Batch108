        1)   NOTE: leap year is very common INTERVIEW question
        Type java code by using nested ternary.
        Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
        If the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400.
        If a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 4.


        /* 2) (day 4)
                Ask user to enter a password
              If the initial of the password is uppercase
               check if it is 'A' or not.
               If it is 'A' the output will be "Valid Password"
               otherwise the output will be "Invalid Password"
               For example; Ali ==> Valid password    -     ali ==> Invalid    -    Mark ==> Invalid

              If the initial of the password is lowercase
                  check if it is 'z' or not.
                  If it is 'z' the output will be "Valid Password"
                  otherwise the output will be "Invalid Password"
               For example; zoe ==> Valid password    -     Zoe ==> Invalid    -    john ==> Invalid

        // 8) Type code to check if a character is unique in a String or not (day06)



        //Example : Check SSN for the following rules
        //       1)it must have just digits
